# Project Collaboration Overview

This project was carried out in collaboration with a classmate, Nouhelia (GitHub: https://github.com/alonelydoll), where we both worked together, communicating effectively at all times. After I prepared the routes and the corresponding "views" folder with their respective paths, she took charge of the back-end for handling the information. 

During this project, we each took on both front-end and back-end responsibilities, ultimately resulting in two different applications. 

## Features of the Application
- **User Authentication**: Login, Register, and Logout functionalities.
- **Job Management**: Add a job, update a job, and filter jobs.
- **Profile Management**: Add and update a CV, add a profile picture.

## Application Links
- The link to the application where I worked on the front-end can be found here: [Front-End Application Link].
- The link to the application where I worked on the back-end can be found here: [Back-End Application Link].
